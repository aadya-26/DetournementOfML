# Concept
####  
Repurposing an existing emotion recognition model from Hugging Face and use it on images of inanimate objects instead of human faces.
The idea is to see what “emotions” the model projects onto things like chairs, rocks, or coffee cups, and to play with the absurdity and poetry of those results.

## Poetic or Political Message

#### 
Poetic: The project envisions that even the most mundane objects possess a sense of feeling, a quiet rebellion against a human-centered world.

Political: It critiques how machine learning systems claim to “read” emotions or truth, when in fact they project human bias onto whatever they see.
